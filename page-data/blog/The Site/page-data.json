In this post we describe the initial \nGitHub pages site.\n\n<!-- end excerpt -->\n\n## GitHub Pages Setup\n\n[GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com) allow you to host s website in GitHub Organisation, Account or Repository. For\nSports CRM we are hosting the site at the organisation level. To do this, the first step is to create a GitHub \nrepository following the correct the naming convention. For the Sports CRM organisation, this is \n[sports-crm.github.io](https://github.com/sports-crm/sports-crm.github.io).\n\nThe second step is to tell Github where to serve the content for your site from. This is done in the main settings page\nfor the repository that contains your contents. You can specify a particular branch and then either the root folder or\nthe /docs folder. As we are using Gatsby to generate our site, we will serve the content from the root of a specific \nbranch, github-pages. You can find out more about how we get the Gatsby generated site into this branch below.  \n\n## The Site Source Code\n\nThe site itself is generated from [React](https://reactjs.org/) based typescript code using \n[Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/). Gatsby is a \"free, open source framework for building fast, powerful websites\".\n\nThe [initial site](https://github.com/sports-crm/sports-crm.github.io/releases/tag/v1.0.0-0) was simply a bunch of \nstatic components styled with [Bulma](https://bulma.io/).\n\nThis blogpost is the first attempt at introducing dynamic content to the site. This is based on the \n[Gatsby Tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/tutorial/). However, instead of adding a field to the existing \n'markdownRemark' node we create a new 'blogPost' node, via our own plugin.\n\n## Publishing the site\n\nBecause GitHub will only serve content from the repository root or '/docs' directory, and Gatsby will only generate\ncontent to the '/public' folder, we use Git worktree to build the site and commit it to the root of an orphaned branch,\n'github-pages'.\n\nCurrently, publishing the site is manual process that requires the following steps. This process should be automated, \nprobably using [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions).\n\nFrom the repository root:- \n```shell\ngasby clean\ngit worktree add public github-pages\ngatsby build\ncd public\ngit add -f -A .\ngit commit -m \"commit_message\"\ngit push origin github-pages\n```"}},"pageContext":{"id":"9689e7e0-fb95-5db3-a0d0-856ebd8ea74d","slug":"/blog/The Site"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
